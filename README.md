### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Profile! I am Steven Spencer, a former Team Lead and an endorsed student from Lambda School
I'm from Worcester Massachusetts and spend most of my time either programming, working on my cars, or listening to music

Most of my programming work is in React, Python, and NodeJS, however I also have knowledge in HTML, JavaScript, Java, and CSS, and I also know how to use technologies such as LESS, Styled Components, Reactstrap, Bootstrap, Redux, and Context API, and AngularJS.

You can find my portfolio website at https://www.stevenswspencer.com, or you can get in touch with me directly at steve35spencer@gmail.com
