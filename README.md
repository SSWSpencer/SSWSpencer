Hey, I'm Steven.
I make stuff to make my life easier because nobody wants to pay me to make stuff to make their lives easier

I used to be involved in a 'bootcamp' because I thought I was too good for a degree and wanted to take the 'easy' route, so pay little attention to like 99% of the web dev stuff with weird names.
